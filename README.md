welcome you to our repo for our DBMS group project!

Navigations:

**ERD** - picture of our ERD design

**Project_Question_Solutions_Doc** - The solutions doc that has the contents for tasks 1-12, commands we used for table creation, the contents, and all the test cases we ran through with screenshots and guides as to how we got from input to output

**project_code.py** - This is our source code that we run for all the tasks and tests

**Link_to_Video_walkthrough_demo_presentation.txt** - a txt with the link for a video walkthrough and demonstration of our project and tasks.

What you need to compile and run on Windows:
- MYSQL WorkBench
- Python 3
- Pip
- MYSQL Connector
- Settup a local MYSQL server with the same credentials as in the source code
- Settup the DBMS in an identical schema as the one we've presented, with the same data
